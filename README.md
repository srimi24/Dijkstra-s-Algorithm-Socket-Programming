# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-Socket-Programming

### This project implements shortest-distance computation with Dijkstra's Algorithm along with Socket Programming.

## HOW DOES IT WORK?
  ### The client connects to the server and sends a node number to the server which calculates the shortest distance from that node to every other node using Dijkstra's Algorithm and sends it to the client. 
  ### The connection between the server and client is implemented using Socket Programming
