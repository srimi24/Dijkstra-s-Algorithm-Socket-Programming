# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-Socket-Programming

### This project implements shortest-distance computation with Dijkstra's Algorithm along with Socket Programming.

## HOW DOES IT WORK?
        ### The client gets connected with the server. It sends a vertex number to the server and the server calculates the shortest distance from that node to every other node using Dijkstra's Algorithm and sends it to the client. 
        ### TThe connection between the server and client is implemented using Socket Programming
